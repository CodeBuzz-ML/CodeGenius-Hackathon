            <p class="card-content">
                Wildfires are uncontrolled fires that spread quickly through combustible vegetation, such as forests, grasslands, or brush. They can occur naturally due to lightning strikes or volcanic eruptions, but they are often caused by human activities like campfires, discarded cigarettes, or intentional arson.
                
                These fires can have devastating consequences, including loss of life, destruction of property, damage to ecosystems, and air pollution. They are particularly dangerous in areas with hot and dry climates, where vegetation is highly flammable and fire can spread rapidly.
                
                Efforts to prevent and control wildfires involve various strategies, including creating firebreaks, prescribed burning, and public education campaigns to promote fire safety. Additionally, firefighting teams and resources are deployed to contain and extinguish wildfires when they occur.
